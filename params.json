{"name":"Jsmailsender","body":"JSMailSender\r\n============\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n------\r\n\r\nJSMailSender is a simple SMTP client for iOS and Mac OS X. If you need to send a quick\r\nemail or two without activating the iOS mail app, this project should help you out. If\r\nyou want to create the next great Mail client in IOS, keep looking. Or better yet,\r\nfork and extend this project.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n------\r\n\r\nFor a while I have been maintaining a [fork](https://github.com/jetseven/skpsmtpmessage)\r\nof the apparently abandoned [skpsmtpmessage](http://code.google.com/p/skpsmtpmessage/). \r\nBased on the feedback on that project, it still fills a need. I wasted to make the library work better\r\nin the background, so I tried to integrate Quinn \"The Eskimo!\"'s class QRunLoopOperation,\r\nwhich elegantly combines NSRunLoop-based APIs with NSOperations. But I was finding it hard\r\nto make changes cleanly, mostly because of the complex conditional code used to manage the state\r\nof the SMTP connection. I decided to do away with all the manual condition checking and\r\nto use the [State Machine Compiler](http://smc.sourceforge.net/) to\r\ngenerate the complex conditions of an SMTP connection. I decided the result was different\r\nenough to merit a new project. I hope that by basing the code\r\non a state  machine, it will make it easier to accomodate new behaviors from mail server I haven't\r\nbeen able to test against.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe project will build and send mail. I am able to send mail using iCloud (me.com),\r\nGmail, and Yahoo! That said, there is still work to do.\r\n\r\n**Working features**\r\n\r\n* Start TLS\r\n* PLAIN and LOGIN authentication\r\n* Tested on common mail servers.\r\n\r\n**Unimplemented or incomplete, but planned**\r\n\r\n* No CRAM-MD5 authentication\r\n* State Machine is incomplete.\r\n    * Some transitions will leave a stream hanging in the open state.\r\n    * Some transitions will throw an exception.\r\n* Should be better integrated with the reachability APIs on iOS.\r\n* Gracefully handle network timeouts.\r\n* Documentation\r\n* Better testing\r\n\r\n**Non Features**\r\n\r\n* MIME\r\n* POP, IMAP\r\n* SMTP Server\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nApple DTS in general and Quinn in particular. The QRunLoopOperation class is copied\r\nwithout modifications.\r\n\r\nColloquy project, for the Base64 code.\r\n\r\nIan Baird, for sksmtpmessage. Even though I created a new project, I still looked at his\r\ncode for a sanity check.","tagline":"A quick SMTP client for iOS and Mac OS X","google":"UA-32594537-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
